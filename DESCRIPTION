Description: Predict detection probability from a gam object defining the probability of detection, given depth (the visibility model), a gam object defining the probability of the target being within 2m of the surface (p(x<2)), and a data frame giving the values of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of depth at a few points from 0m to 3m. It is assumed that the actual CDF of depth (the depth model) is this CDF scaled so that its value at 2 is equal to the p(x<2) obtained from the gam object defining p(x<2). The predicted detection probability is the expected value of p(x<2) under this CDF of depth.
